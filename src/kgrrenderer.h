/* @short A class to assist theme-handling and rendering in KGoldrunner.
 *
 * KGoldrunner has two SVG files for each theme: one to hold the Actors (hero
 * and enemies) and one to hold the Set (bricks, ladders, background, etc.).
 *
 * The files are marked with the keywords "Actors" and "Set" in each theme's
 * .desktop file, rather than the usual "Filename" keyword. There are two
 * KgThemeProvider objects and two KGameRenderer objects, each with its own
 * set of SVG files and KgTheme objects.
 *
 * There is one KgThemeSelector object, which selects the "Set" theme and uses
 * the "Set" KgThemeProvider. Its currentThemeChanged signal is connected to a
 * currentThemeChanged slot in KGrRenderer, which finds the KgTheme for the
 * corresponding "Actors" theme and SVG file.
 *
 * KGoldrunner also has several different usages of the KGameRenderer concepts
 * of "frameSuffix" and "frameBaseIndex". For animation frames (hero, enemies
 * and dug bricks), it always has frameSuffix = "_%1" and frameBaseIndex = 1, so
 * animation will be handled normally by KGameRenderer. 
 *
 * Depending on the theme and the artist's choices, backgrounds and tiles can
 * have one or more variants, to add variety to the look of brick walls, etc.
 * The suffixes used can be "-%1" or just "%1" and the frameBaseIndex = 0, or
 * there can be just one variant, with no suffix. The keyTable structure and the
 * getPixmapKey() and getBackgroundKey() methods of KGrRenderer provide ways to
 * go from KGoldrunner's internal tile-types to SVG element names that can be
 * used as pixmap keys in KGameRenderer.
