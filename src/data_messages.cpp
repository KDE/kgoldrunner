// names and descriptions of games and names and hints for levels. The
// C++ comments indicate which data file the strings came from.  You
// may sometimes need to look at the corresponding game or level graphics
// to work out a good translation (e.g. Initiation 25, Mongolian Horde).

// To ease the burden on translators, this file does not include all the
// data messages.  For example, the hints on championship games are not
// included.  A player that good should not need a hint and maybe has no
// need of a translation ... :-)  The most urgent translations would be
// names and hints for the Tutorial games, then the game names and
// descriptions (as appearing in the main dialog box) and then the other
// level names and hints.
