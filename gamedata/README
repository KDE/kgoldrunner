Data files for KGoldrunner games    6 Oct 2015
----------------------------------------------

File names are of the form <file type>_<game ID>.<suffix>, where the suffix is
either "txt" for ASCII text or "dat" for binary data.  The game ID is an ASCII
string or "prefix" that uniquely identifies a game and its levels, eg. "tute".

The file types are:

    game    A file containing data to define a game and all its levels.  It is
            in the form of pseudo C++ code, so that its strings (names, hints
            and descriptions) can be extracted for use by language translators.

    hi      A binary file of target high-scores for a game.

    sol     A recording of play of levels of a game, which can be replayed to
            show the user solutions to levels.  The file is in KConfig format.

    rec     Similar to "sol" type in purpose and format, but see below.

File "rec_demo.txt" contains recordings of the levels in the KGoldrunner Demo.

Files "rec_GMGR.txt" and "rec_GRII.txt" are solutions for the Gold Rush and Gold
Rush II games.  The old "rec" file names, rather than "sol" names, are retained
for backwards compatibility.
