/*i18n:
   NOTES: Files 'gamedata/game_*.txt' are KGoldrunner DATA files.  They
   are installed in $KDEDIR/share/apps/kgoldrunner/system and contain
   names and descriptions of games, plus names and hints for levels.  You
   may sometimes need to look at the corresponding game or level graphics
   to work out a good translation (e.g. Initiation 25, Mongolian Horde).

   To see any level of any game, run KGoldrunner, cancel the startup
   dialog and select menu Game->Play Any Level...  If you start to play
   a level, you will probably need to stop the animation by pressing
   the Pause key (default Esc or P).

   To ease the burden on translators, the .pot does not include all the
   data messages.  For example, the hints on championship games are not
   included.  A player that good should not need a hint and maybe has no
   need of a translation ... :-)  The most urgent translations would be
   names and hints for the Tutorial games, then the game names and
   descriptions (as appearing in the main dialog box) and then the other
   level names and hints.
