   NOTES: Files 'gamedata/game_*.txt' are KGoldrunner DATA files.  They
   are installed in $KDEDIR/share/apps/kgoldrunner/system and contain
   names and descriptions of games, plus names and hints for levels.  You
   may sometimes need to look at the corresponding game or level graphics
   to work out a good translation (e.g. Initiation 25, Mongolian Horde).

   To see any level of any game, run KGoldrunner, click on the New Game button
   and select the game and level from the list.  If you start to play a level,
   you will probably need to stop the animation by pressing the Pause key
   (default Esc or P).

   The most urgent translations would be names and hints for the Tutorial
   games, then the game names and descriptions (as appearing in the main
   dialog box) and then the other level names and finally the remaining
   hints, which are intended for experienced players and champions.

   Messages marked as NOTi18n should deliberately be left untranslated. The
   one below is never displayed and others, from time to time, would be long
   hint texts used by a small number of championship players, left untranslated
   to economise on translation effort.

   The "Das Boot" message in level 97 of the Initiation game is the name of
   a German submarine warfare movie, left untranslated as a compliment to the
   original author of KGoldrunner, who is German.  The movie is known as
   "Das Boot" in many countries, including English-speaking countries.  If it
   is known by some other name in your country, please include that in your
   translation of the corresponding hint text.  See this Internet page:
