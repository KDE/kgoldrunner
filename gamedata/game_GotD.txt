 i18n("Lets face it: the ground with nowhere to run or dig is not where you want to be when the zombies come for you. However, every time you collect some gold you end up down there. The trick is to have the zombies falling overhead as you run beneath them to one of the side ladders.\n"
 "\n"
 "One possibility is to wait near the top of a ladder (but not an outer one) until the zombies also gather up high. Then descend, take as much gold with you as possible and quickly return to the ladder. If you are lucky the zombies will still be in the air when you reach it.\n"
 "\n"
 "If one of the zombies has reached the ladder before you, try going up it. Often that will make the zombie run away from you and maybe exit to one side and fall. The zombie will go up only as far as what he thinks is the nearest exit, but he does not understand gravity very well... On the right there is a bar next to the ladder, which is fine, but on the left there is a piece of gold next to the ladder and the zombies think they can walk on it, so they will go only one space past it if you push them up the ladder.\n"
 "\n"
 "If you are lucky, the zombies will remove that gold before you get there. Or they may be some distance away when you arrive, so it is easy to collect. Failing that, you have to push the zombies up just a bit higher than the gold, then quickly run up, dive sideways and collect the gold. After that you must run back to the ladder and push them up and over the bar, up higher, which is their new exit point.\n"
 "\n"
 "Another possibility, which is faster but maybe riskier, is to wait above a series of gold pieces you wish to collect until the zombies get above their exit point on a side ladder, then fall and collect the gold and either rest on your last concrete block or be falling when the zombies reach their exit. They will then leave the ladder and fall while you run across under them and climb the ladder one more time.\n"
 "\n"
 "These possibilities are demonstrated in the recorded solution for Free Fall, but it does things the hard way: it is actually easier to work from right to left when collecting the gold. One last hint: if a zombie drops some gold, collect it on your next trip, before it gets picked up again.");
