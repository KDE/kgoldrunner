KGoldrunner v1.0.2 - Known Problems
-----------------------------------

1.  In the KDE 1 and Qt v1.x implementation, multi-line edit boxes do not
    wrap text lines (in Qt 2.x they can, and KGoldrunner uses that feature).

    There is extra code (for temporary use with Qt1.x only) to wrap the text
    in read-only boxes used for displaying hints, tutorial text and game
    descriptions.  However, if you want to create or EDIT hints and
    descriptions, you will have to handle a paragraph as one very long
    line, using a horizontal scrollbar.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

2.  In Qt 3, multi-line edit boxes have been declared obsolete and the
    functions that handle counts of lines have been deleted.  KGoldrunner
    used those functions to work out how far to shrink a box that had just
    a few lines of text.  In the Qt3 version of KGoldrunner such boxes now
    have empty space in them.
