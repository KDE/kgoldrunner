KGoldrunner v1.0.3 - Known Problems
-----------------------------------

1.  Development of the KDE 1 version of KGoldrunner has been discontinued.
    There is still a tarball for it on "apps.kde.com" under "kgoldrunner".

2.  In Qt 3, multi-line edit boxes have been declared obsolete and the
    functions that handle counts of lines have been deleted.  KGoldrunner
    used those functions to work out how far to shrink a box that had just
    a few lines of text.  In the Qt3 version of KGoldrunner such boxes now
    have empty space in them.

3.  KGoldrunner v1.0.3 should compile and run with KDE 2, if you remove the
    -DQT3 compiler flag, but it has NOT been regression-tested with KDE 2.
