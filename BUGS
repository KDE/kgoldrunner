KGoldrunner v2.0 - Known Problems
---------------------------------

1.  Development of the KDE 1 version of KGoldrunner has been discontinued.
    There is still a tarball for it on "apps.kde.com" under "kgoldrunner".

2.  Now that KGoldrunner v2.0 has been re-written as a KDE 3 application
    it is no longer portable to non-KDE systems, however a portable
    (non-KDE) version of KGoldrunner, based on Qt 3, has been written
    and is currently under test.

3.  KGoldrunner 2.0 is not designed to work with KDE 2.  It has been tested with
    KDE 3.1.1 and Qt 3.1.1.

4.  In KGoldrunner 2.0, the KDE library produces the following error message
    occasionally when KDialogbase or KMessageBox is run:

          WARNING: KDE detected X Error: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
          \x08 Major opcode:  *

    This apppears to be harmless, i.e. all the desired dialog entries are
    received by the application and the messages appear on the screen.  One
    way the X error message can be forced to appear is to run "exec()" twice on
    one dialog object, e.g, as in a data-entry validation loop:

          while (dialogName->exec() == QDialog::Accepted) {
	      if validation fails
	          issue error message;
	          continue;
	      else
	          break;
          }

    Maybe this is a bug in KDE 3.1.1 and maybe it is already fixed in later KDE.
    It happens if you do "exec()" twice on an empty KDialogbase object (i.e. one
    with just OK and Cancel buttons and a caption), so I don't think KGoldrunner
    is responsible.  Also, the "while ... exec()" loop works fine with QDialog
    objects and always has.
