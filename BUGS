KGoldrunner v1.0 - Known Problems
---------------------------------

1.  Sometimes, but not for long, a runner will vanish.  The more common cases
    have been fixed, but the basic problem is that the Qt library, especially
    in Qt v2.x, seems to assume that you are going to do ALL painting in a
    "paintEvent" function, after you have returned control to the QApplication.

    The Qt documentation hints at this (e.g. in the tutorial), but never seems
    to say it explicitly.  KGoldrunner does "setBackgroundPixmap", "erase" and
    "drawPixmap" as the game proceeds and would require major structural change
    and re-testing to implement "paintEvent" fully.

2.  In the KDE 1 and Qt v1.x implementation, multi-line edit boxes do not
    wrap text lines (in Qt 2.x they can, and KGoldrunner uses that feature).

    There is extra code (for temporary use with Qt1.x only) to wrap the text
    in read-only boxes used for displaying hints, tutorial text and game
    descriptions.  However, if you want to create or EDIT hints and
    descriptions, you will have to handle a paragraph as one very long
    line, using a horizontal scrollbar.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
