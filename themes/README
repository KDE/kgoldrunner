THEMES IN KGOLDRUNNER

For each pictorial theme in KGoldrunner there is a "*.desktop" file in the area
kdegames/kgoldrunner/themes in the KDE SVN source-code repository, or in the
area $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kgoldrunner/themes, the user's local data area.  If
two *.desktop files have the same name, the one in the local area takes
precedence.

Files in the SVN area are released and installed with KGoldrunner.  Files in
the local area can be used for development and testing of themes or for holding
downloaded and copied themes, whatever the method of transfer or copying.  One
of the theme files is called "default.desktop".  That theme is used whenever
the game runs for the first time for a particular user.  On subsequent
occasions the last-used theme is loaded.

Each *.desktop file must start with the "group" line, which says
[KDEGameTheme].  There must also be a line which gives the name of the theme
(e.g. Name=Foo Bar).  That line gets picked up and translated into various
languages.  Some other standard (but optional) lines are 
Description=...,
Author=..., 
AuthorEmail=...  and 
VersionFormat=...

SVG THEMES

SVG themes are the standard for KGoldrunner 3+ (KDE 4+).  The *.desktop file
must contain a Set=xxxx line and an Actors=yyyy line, that contain the
filenames in which to find the SVG graphics for the tiles and background (the
set) and the runners (the actors).  The filenames must end in .svg or .svgz and
the file must be in or relative to the same folder as the *.desktop file.  By
convention, the files are always in a sub-folder named after the theme.
Example, theme-file "default.desktop":

    [KDEGameTheme]
    Name=KGoldRunner Default
    Name[el]=Προκαθορισμένο KGoldrunner
    Name[es]=KGoldRunner predeterminado
    Description=A light and clean theme for KDE4
    Description[el]=Ένα απλό και ελαφρύ θέμα για το KDE4
    Description[es]=Un tema luminoso y limpio para KDE4
    Author=Mauricio Piacentini
    Set=default/set.svg
    Actors=default/actors.svg
    DrawCanvasBorder=1
    BorderColor=#2C89A0
    TextColor=#FFFFFF

Note that Name and Description have been translated.  DrawCanvasBorder=1 says
that a border is required around this theme, rather than the default behavior
of letting the background fill the canvas (see below).  BorderColor and
TextColor supply hex color codes for the border area and the text of the
game and level titles.

As SVG themes become more sophisticated, it is expected that other meta-data
will be needed in the *.desktop files.  Such changes must be matched with
code-changes, by KGoldrunner's maintainers, that will read the new meta-data
and act on it.  Artists and maintainers need to work together on this.

SVG ELEMENTS

The elements in the SVG file must have standard names, corresponding to their
role in the KGoldrunner game.  Each element should be set in a perfectly square
space.  It will typically be displayed in about 24x24 to 36x36 pixels (7-10mm),
so detail can be sketchy, as for an icon.  The elements are:

    empty           An empty square: used in the game-editor.
    gold            Any kind of prize or reward, not necessarily a gold piece.
    hero_n          A set of frames for the running hero (e.g. n = 1 to 36).
    enemy_n         An equivalent set of frames for the enemies.
    gold_enemy_n    An equivalent set of frames for enemies carrying gold.
    concrete        A piece of hard floor that the hero CANNOT dig through.
    brick           A piece of floor that the hero CAN dig through.
    brick_n         A set of frames for brick-digging animation (n = 1 to 9).
    ladder          A means for the hero and enemies to move upward.
    bar             A means for the hero and enemies to move over an abyss.
    false_brick     A piece of floor that gives way under the hero and enemies.
    hidden_ladder   A ladder that appears when the hero has all the gold and can
                    proceed to the next level of the game.
    background      See below.
    background<n>   Background set (n starts at 0)

The background element is not square like the others.  It will be displayed
behind the other elements and scaled to a space equivalent to 32 x 24 smaller
elements, at least.  It could be stretched further in either direction, at the
user's whim, and will always fill the central widget.  The actual play-area
will always be 28 x 20 square elements.  The play-area has a thin black frame
around it and a title-text above it.  The space around the play-area is a
buffer-zone, to protect against mouse-action spilling over into the surrounding
desktop.

As an alternative to a single background element, a series named background0,
background1, ... backgroundn can be provided. Each level will load a different
background until the last background provided is reached, after which the first
one is used again.

It is possible that the background and animation frames could be provided as
PNG files, depending on the source (e.g. photograph or animation package).
That is yet to be decided.

The background should make arbitrary arrangements of smaller elements easily
visible and recognisable to the game player, i.e. it must be playable in all
levels of all games.  This should be tested by displaying several levels with a
new theme before it is released (e.g. use the Game->New Game... dialog).

KGoldrunner 3.1 allows more options to the graphics designer to customize the
look of the game.  The themes from KGoldrunner 3.0 are so far compatible with
kgoldrunner 3.1; it is possible to develop a theme for KDE 3.1 that is still
compatible with the old version with the use of some care.

New element for version 3.1 of KGoldrunner:
A frame surrounding the border area can be specified as svg tiles now.

The tiles have to be named:
frame-topleft 
frame-top
frame-topright
frame-left 
frame-fill       (not actually used, but must be present.)
frame-right
frame-bottomleft
frame-bottom
frame-bottomright

The frame-top, frame-bottom, frame-left and frame-right tiles are repeated
along the border of the playing area to connecte the four corners.

It is possible to give a border to the display areas for the score and lives,
which are displayed now in the safe area at the bottom of the screen. To do so, the theme must include the following tiles:
display-left
display-centre
display-right

Finally, most tiles may have a few variants to make the playground less
repetitive. These are the tiles that can have variants:
bar
ladder
concrete
brick

The variants must be named bar-0, ..., bar-<N> brick-0, ..., brick-<N> as
consecutive numbers.

To make the theme work in KGoldrunner 3.0, a tile without the numbering suffix
must be provided. This tile is not used by version 3.1 if numbered tiles are
present.
