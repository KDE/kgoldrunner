THEMES IN KGOLDRUNNER

For each pictorial theme in KGoldrunner there is a "*.desktop" file in the area
kdegames/kgoldrunner/pics in the KDE SVN source-code repository, or in the area
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/kgoldrunner/pics, the user's local data area.  If two
*.desktop files have the same name, the one in the local area takes precedence.

Files in the SVN area are released and installed with KGoldrunner.  Files in the
local area can be used for development and testing of themes or for holding
downloaded and copied themes, whatever the method of transfer or copying.  One
of the theme files is called "default.desktop".  That theme is used whenever
the game runs for the first time for a particular user.  On subsequent occasions
the last-used theme is loaded.

Each *.desktop file must start with the "group" line, which says [KDEGameTheme].
There must also be a line which gives the name of the theme (e.g. Name=Foo Bar).
That line gets picked up and translated into various languages.  Some other
standard (but optional) lines are Description=..., Author=..., AuthorEmail=...
and VersionFormat=...

XPM THEMES

XPM themes are retained from KGoldrunner 2 (KDE 3) as "classic" or "nostalgia"
items.  The required graphics are embedded in the program, together with an
array of color-schemes.  The *.desktop file must contain a ColorIndex=n line,
to indicate which color-scheme to use.  Example, theme-file "apple_2.desktop":

    [KDEGameTheme]
    Name=Apple II
    Author=Ian Wadham
    ColorIndex=1

SVG THEMES

SVG themes are the standard for KGoldrunner 3+ (KDE 4+).  The *.desktop file
must contain a FileName=xxxx line to indicate where to find the SVG graphics.
The filename must end in .svg or .svgz and the file must be in or relative to
the same folder as the *.desktop file.  Example, theme-file "default.desktop":

    [KDEGameTheme]
    Name=KGoldRunner Default
    Name[sv]=Standard Kgoldrunner
    Description=A light and clean theme for KDE4
    Description[sv]=Ett lätt och rent tema för KDE4
    Author=Mauricio Piacentini
    FileName=kgr_default.svg
    DrawCanvasBorder=1
    BorderColor=#2C89A0
    TextColor=#FFFFFF

Note that Name and Description have been translated (into Swedish).
DrawCanvasBorder=1 says that a border is required around this theme, rather
than the default behavior of letting the background fill the canvas (see
below).  BorderColor and TextColor supply hex color codes for the border
area and the text of the game and level titles.

As SVG themes become more sophisticated, it is expected that other meta-data
will be needed in the *.desktop files.  Such changes must be matched with
code-changes by KGoldrunner's maintainers that will read the new meta-data
and act on it.  Artists and maintainers need to work together on this.

SVG ELEMENTS

The elements in the SVG file must have standard names, corresponding to their
role in the KGoldrunner game.  Each element should be set in a perfectly square
space.  It will typically be displayed in about 24x24 to 36x36 pixels (7-10mm),
so detail can be sketchy, as for an icon.  The elements are:

    gold            Any kind of prize or reward, not necessarily a gold piece.
    hero_n          A set of frames for the running hero (e.g. n = 1 to 36).
    enemy_n         An equivalent set of frames for the enemies.
    gold_enemy_n    An equivalent set of frames for enemies carrying gold.
    concrete        A piece of hard floor that the hero CANNOT dig through.
    brick           A piece of floor that the hero CAN dig through.
    brick_n         A set of frames for brick-digging animation (n = 1 to 9).
    ladder          A means for the hero and enemies to move upward.
    bar             A means for the hero and enemies to move over an abyss.
    false_brick     A piece of floor that gives way under the hero and enemies.
    hidden_ladder   A ladder that appears when the hero has all the gold and can
                    proceed to the next level of the game.
    background      See below.

The background element is not square like the others.  It will be displayed
behind the other elements and scaled to a space equivalent to 32 x 24 smaller
elements, at least.  It could be stretched further in either direction, at the
user's whim, and will always fill the central widget.  The actual play-area will
always be 28 x 20 square elements.  The play-area has a thin black frame around
it and a title-text above it.  The space around the play-area is a buffer-zone,
to protect against mouse-action spilling over into the surrounding desktop.

It is possible that the background and animation frames could be provided as PNG
files, depending on the source (e.g. photograph or animation package).  That is
yet to be decided.

The background should make arbitrary arrangements of smaller elements easily
visible and recognisable to the game player, i.e. it must be playable in all
levels of all games.  This should be tested by displaying several levels with
a new theme before it is released (e.g. use the Game->Play Any Level dialog).
