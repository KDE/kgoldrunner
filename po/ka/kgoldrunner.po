"Lets face it: the ground with nowhere to run or dig is not where you want to "
"be when the zombies come for you. However, every time you collect some gold "
"you end up down there. The trick is to have the zombies falling overhead as "
"you run beneath them to one of the side ladders.\n"
"\n"
"One possibility is to wait near the top of a ladder (but not an outer one) "
"until the zombies also gather up high. Then descend, take as much gold with "
"you as possible and quickly return to the ladder. If you are lucky the "
"zombies will still be in the air when you reach it.\n"
"\n"
"If one of the zombies has reached the ladder before you, try going up it. "
"Often that will make the zombie run away from you and maybe exit to one side "
"and fall. The zombie will go up only as far as what he thinks is the nearest "
"exit, but he does not understand gravity very well... On the right there is "
"a bar next to the ladder, which is fine, but on the left there is a piece of "
"gold next to the ladder and the zombies think they can walk on it, so they "
"will go only one space past it if you push them up the ladder.\n"
"\n"
"If you are lucky, the zombies will remove that gold before you get there. Or "
"they may be some distance away when you arrive, so it is easy to collect. "
"Failing that, you have to push the zombies up just a bit higher than the "
"gold, then quickly run up, dive sideways and collect the gold. After that "
"you must run back to the ladder and push them up and over the bar, up "
"higher, which is their new exit point.\n"
"\n"
"Another possibility, which is faster but maybe riskier, is to wait above a "
"series of gold pieces you wish to collect until the zombies get above their "
"exit point on a side ladder, then fall and collect the gold and either rest "
"on your last concrete block or be falling when the zombies reach their exit. "
"They will then leave the ladder and fall while you run across under them and "
"climb the ladder one more time.\n"

"left when collecting the gold. One last hint: if a zombie drops some gold, "
